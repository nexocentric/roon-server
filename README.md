# Docker for Roon using Photon OS

Docker container for [Roon], based on Photon OS linux
Based on the great work of [steefdebruijn] who did the same based on a debian-slim image.
All informations to troubleshoot your linux server can be found [here]

## Differences
- ffmpeg is installed manually from official sources
- Uses local volumes for app, data, music and backups folders

## Steps
- First clone the repo
- Change TZ param in docker-compose.yaml
- Uncomment privileged if you encounter problems with network mounts

## Run container with docker compose
```sh
docker-compose up -d
```

## Run container
```sh
docker run -d \
  --net=host \
  -e TZ="Europe/Paris" \
  -v ./app:/app \
  -v ./data:/data \
  -v ./music:/music \
  -v ./backups:/backup \
  davindisko/roon-photon:latest
```
